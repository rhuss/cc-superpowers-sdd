# SDD Help

## Overview

Display the SDD quick reference with workflow diagram, command list, and guidance.

## Behavior

1. Read and display the quick reference content from `sdd/docs/help.md`
2. Display the content exactly as written
3. Ask: "Any questions about the SDD workflow? I can explain any command in detail."

## Key Principles

- **Reference mode is fast**: Just display the help content
- **Non-pushy**: Offer options, don't force workflows
