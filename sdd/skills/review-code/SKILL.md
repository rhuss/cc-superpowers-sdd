# Code Review Against Specification

## Overview

Review code implementation against specification to ensure compliance.

**Key Difference from Standard Code Review:**
- Primary focus: **Does code match spec?**
- Secondary focus: Code quality, patterns, best practices
- Output: **Compliance score** + deviation list
- Triggers: **Spec evolution** if mismatches found

## When to Use

- After implementation complete (called by `sdd:implement`)
- Before merging/deploying code
- When validating existing code against spec
- As part of verification workflow

## The Process

### 1. Load Spec and Code

**Read specification:**
```bash
cat specs/features/[feature-name].md
```

**Identify implementation files:**
```bash
# From implementation plan or code exploration
ls -la [implementation-files]
```

### 2. Review Functional Requirements

**For each functional requirement in spec:**

1. **Find implementation** in code
2. **Compare behavior**: Does code do what spec says?
3. **Check completeness**: All aspects implemented?
4. **Note deviations**: Any differences?

**Create compliance matrix:**
```
Requirement 1: [Spec text]
  Implementation: [file:line]
  Status: ✓ Compliant | ✗ Deviation | ? Missing
  Notes: [If deviation, explain]

Requirement 2: [Spec text]
  ...
```

### 3. Review Error Handling

**For each error case in spec:**

1. **Find error handling** in code
2. **Check error response**: Matches spec?
3. **Verify error codes**: Correct HTTP status / error codes?
4. **Test error messages**: Clear and helpful?

**Error handling compliance:**
```
Error Case 1: [From spec]
  Implemented: Yes/No
  Location: [file:line]
  Response: [What code returns]
  Spec Expected: [What spec says]
  Status: ✓ / ✗
```

### 4. Review Edge Cases

**For each edge case in spec:**

1. **Find handling** in code
2. **Check behavior**: Matches spec?
3. **Verify tests**: Edge case tested?

### 5. Check for Extra Features

**Identify code features NOT in spec:**

- Functions/endpoints not mentioned in spec
- Behavior beyond spec requirements
- Additional error handling
- Extra validations

**For each extra feature:**
- Document what it does
- Assess: Helpful addition or scope creep?
- Note for potential spec update

### 6. Calculate Compliance Score

**Formula:**
```
Compliance % = (Compliant Requirements / Total Requirements) × 100
```

**Include:**
- Functional requirements
- Error cases
- Edge cases
- Non-functional requirements

**Example:**
```
Functional: 8/8 = 100%
Error Cases: 3/4 = 75%
Edge Cases: 2/3 = 67%
Non-Functional: 3/3 = 100%

Overall: 16/18 = 89%
```

### 7. Generate Report

**Report structure:**

```markdown
# Code Review: [Feature Name]

**Spec:** specs/features/[feature].md
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reviewer:** Claude (sdd:review-code)

## Compliance Summary

**Overall Score: XX%**

- Functional Requirements: X/X (XX%)
- Error Handling: X/X (XX%)
- Edge Cases: X/X (XX%)
- Non-Functional: X/X (XX%)

## Detailed Review

### Functional Requirements

#### ✓ Requirement 1: [Spec text]
**Implementation:** src/[file]:line
**Status:** Compliant
**Notes:** Correctly implemented as specified

#### ✗ Requirement 2: [Spec text]
**Implementation:** src/[file]:line
**Status:** Deviation
**Issue:** [What differs from spec]
**Impact:** [Minor/Major]
**Recommendation:** [Update spec / Fix code]

### Error Handling

[Similar format for each error case]

### Edge Cases

[Similar format for each edge case]

### Extra Features (Not in Spec)

#### [Feature name]
**Location:** src/[file]:line
**Description:** [What it does]
**Assessment:** [Helpful / Scope creep]
**Recommendation:** [Add to spec / Remove]

## Code Quality Notes

[Secondary observations about code quality, patterns, etc.]

## Recommendations

### Critical (Must Fix)
- [ ] [Issue requiring immediate attention]

### Spec Evolution Candidates
- [ ] [Deviation that might warrant spec update]

### Optional Improvements
- [ ] [Nice-to-have suggestions]

## Conclusion

[Overall assessment]

**Next Steps:**
- If compliance < 100%: Use `sdd:evolve` to reconcile deviations
- If compliance = 100%: Proceed to verification
```

### 8. Trigger Evolution if Needed

**If deviations found:**
- Present review results to user
- Recommend using `sdd:evolve`
- Don't proceed to verification until resolved

**If 100% compliant:**
- Approve for verification
- Proceed to `sdd:verification-before-completion`

## Example Output

```
# Code Review: User Profile Update API

**Spec:** specs/features/user-profile-api.md
**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Reviewer:** Claude (sdd:review-code)

## Compliance Summary

**Overall Score: 94%**

- Functional Requirements: 6/6 (100%)
- Error Handling: 4/4 (100%)
- Edge Cases: 3/3 (100%)
- Non-Functional: 2/3 (67%)

## Detailed Review

### Functional Requirements

#### ✓ Requirement 1: PUT endpoint accepts requests
**Implementation:** src/api/users/profile.ts:12
**Status:** Compliant
**Notes:** Route correctly configured at PUT /api/users/:id/profile

#### ✓ Requirement 2: Validates request body
**Implementation:** src/middleware/validation/profile.ts:5
**Status:** Compliant
**Notes:** All validations match spec (name 2-50, bio max 500, avatar_url URL)

[... all ✓ ...]

### Error Handling

#### ✓ Error: Missing/Invalid JWT
**Implementation:** src/middleware/auth.ts:22
**Status:** Compliant
**Spec Expected:** 401 with "Authentication required"
**Actual:** 401 with "Authentication required" ✓

[... all ✓ ...]

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### ✗ Performance: Response time < 200ms
**Status:** Not Verified
**Issue:** No performance testing implemented
**Impact:** Minor (likely meets requirement but unverified)
**Recommendation:** Add performance test or update spec to remove specific timing

### Extra Features (Not in Spec)

#### Updated timestamp in response
**Location:** src/api/users/profile.ts:45
**Description:** Adds `updated_at` timestamp to response object
**Assessment:** Helpful - standard practice for update endpoints
**Recommendation:** Add to spec (minor addition)

## Recommendations

### Spec Evolution Candidates
- [ ] Add `updated_at` field to response spec (minor addition)
- [ ] Remove specific performance timing or add perf tests

## Conclusion

Code implementation is 94% compliant with spec. All functional requirements and error handling correctly implemented. One non-functional requirement unverified and one helpful feature added beyond spec.

**Next Steps:**
Use `sdd:evolve` to update spec with:
1. `updated_at` field (minor addition)
2. Clarify performance requirement (remove specific timing or add test)

After spec evolution, compliance will be 100%.
```

## Assessment Criteria

### Compliant (✓)
- Code does exactly what spec says
- No deviations in behavior
- All aspects covered

### Minor Deviation (⚠)
- Small differences (naming, details)
- Non-breaking additions
- Better error messages than spec
- Typically → Update spec

### Major Deviation (✗)
- Different behavior than spec
- Missing functionality
- Wrong error handling
- Typically → Fix code or evolve spec

### Missing (?)
- Spec requires it, code doesn't have it
- Critical gap
- Must fix code

## Remember

**Spec compliance is primary concern.**

This is not just code quality review - it's **spec validation**.

- Does code match spec? (Most important)
- Is code quality good? (Secondary)
- Any improvements? (Tertiary)

**100% compliance is the goal.**

- < 90%: Significant issues, fix before proceeding
- 90-99%: Minor deviations, likely spec updates
- 100%: Perfect compliance, ready for verification

**Deviations trigger evolution.**

- Don't force-fit wrong spec
- Don't ignore deviations
- Use `sdd:evolve` to reconcile

**The code and spec must tell the same story.**
