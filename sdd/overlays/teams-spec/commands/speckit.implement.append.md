## Spec Guardian: Lead Reviews, Teammates Implement

When this trait is active, the lead acts as a **spec compliance guardian**.
The lead MUST NOT implement tasks itself. Instead, it spawns teammates in
git worktrees, reviews their completed work against spec.md, and only
merges compliant changes.

**This overrides teams-vanilla behavior** when both traits are active.

**Execution**: Delegate to {Skill: sdd:teams-spec-guardian} for worktree
spawning, spec compliance review, merge protocol, and beads bridge.
