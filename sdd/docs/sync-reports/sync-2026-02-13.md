**Upstream Date**: 2026-02-12

## Skills Updated

### writing-plans
**Status**: Merged

**Upstream Changes Integrated**:
- Fix nested code blocks in Task Structure template: use 4-backtick fence instead of 3-backtick to properly contain inner code blocks (commit 19df3db)

**SDD Enhancements Preserved**:
- Spec-first input parsing (section "1. Read and Parse Specification")
- Requirements coverage validation (section "5. Validate Plan Against Spec")
- Plan-to-spec validation (Spec Validation Checklist)
- All spec references in plan template

**Conflicts Resolved**: None

### brainstorm
**Status**: Merged

**Upstream Changes Integrated**:
- HARD-GATE block preventing implementation before approval (commit 7f2ee61)
- Anti-Pattern section: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Spec"
- Checklist with ordered steps (adapted to 8 steps for SDD context)
- Process Flow graphviz diagram (adapted with SDD-specific nodes)
- Terminal state guidance (adapted: `sdd:plan`/`sdd:implement` instead of writing-plans)
- Flexible section sizing ("scale to complexity" instead of fixed 200-300 words)
- One question per message clarification
- Explicit approval before proceeding

**SDD Enhancements Preserved**:
- Prerequisites section (spec-kit initialization, installation check)
- CRITICAL: Use /speckit.* Slash Commands section
- Creating the specification section (spec-kit workflow, manual fallback)
- IMPORTANT: Capture implementation insights separately section
- WHAT vs HOW separation principle
- Spec structure template
- After spec creation (review-spec, consistency check, review_brief.md generation)
- Recommend Constitution section
- Example Flow (adapted for present-approve-create flow)

**Conflicts Resolved**:
- Output type: "design doc" vs "spec" - kept SDD's "spec" throughout
- Terminal state: "writing-plans" vs SDD workflow - used `sdd:plan` or `sdd:implement`
- Checklist steps: expanded from upstream's 6 to 8 for SDD-specific steps
- Process Flow: replaced design-centric nodes with spec-centric nodes
- Anti-Pattern title: changed "Design" to "Spec"

### verification-before-completion
